# My Research Approach

This document describes a set of standards for what I consider to be reliable scientific research. I hold myself to these standards. While I do not necessarily expect others to agree, I do expect any collaborators to adhere to these standards for projects in which I am an author or co-author.

The standards are far from a complete description of valid scientific research. But they are a minimum set that I adhere to. These standards are incomplete and likely to develop, so please feel free to discuss any concerns or disagreements with me.

# Ethics

All human-subject research will comply with appropriate IRB (or local equivalent) guidelines.

# Decision timing

All data collection and analyses will either be preregistered or explicitly described as "exploratory" or "descriptive". Any devations from a preregistration will be noted in the manuscript. An experiment that is preregistered must report the preregistration in the paper.

# Shared research artifacts

## Data collection
We will clearly describe all data collection methods, so that that they can be understood and replicated by others in the field.  All code, stimuli, questionnaires, etc. needed for data collection will be shared. If any data collection materials cannot be shared, the reason will be explained in the paper.

## Data
All data collected for the manuscript will be shared in as raw a format as is reasonable. This data will also include a clear description or "data dictionary" to facilitate reuse. If ethical or practical concerns prevent sharing all of the data, we will share as much as we can and explain why the rest is not shared in the manuscript. However, concerns that prevent sharing should be strongly questioned if unreasonabe (an understandably subjective term).

## Analysis
All material and code needed for analysis will be shared.

# Repositories for sharing
All research materials will be shared on a repository that is:
* Open access to allow free download and reuse (If privacy or other concerns prevent open access, a protected access repository will be used)
* Immutable and uniquely identifiable to ensure that a single consistent identifier will always lead to a single repository (versions may replace it if past versions remain discoverable and viewable)
* Have a clear plan for persistence to allow access for reliable long-term access

Moreover, the artifacts will include a clear and open license for reuse.


# Preprint
When possible, a preprint will be posted publicly prior to submission, and open access piblications will be prioritized.

# IP
Intllectual property concerns may arise, especially for stimuli. While other people's intellectual property concerns may need to be protected, it is not acceptable for authors to refuse to share research artifacts due to their own
