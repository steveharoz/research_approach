# research_approach

All data collected for the manuscript will be made publicly available on an open access repository If ethical or practical concerns prevent sharing all of the data, we will share as much as we can and explain why the rest is not shared in the manuscript.

All code, stimuli, and questionnaires needed for data colpection will be shared.

All material needed for analysis will be shared.

All data collection and analyses will either be preregistered or explicitly described as "exploratory" or "descriptive". Any devations from a preregistration will be noted in the manuscript.

When possible, a preprint will be posted publicly, and open access piblications will be prioritized.
