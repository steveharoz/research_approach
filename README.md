# research_approach

This document describes a set of science standards that I adhere to. I hold myself to these standards, and consequently, I expect all collaborators to adhere to these standards for projects in which I am an author. 

# Shared research artifacts

## Data collection
All code, stimuli, and questionnaires needed for data collection will be shared.

## Data
All data collected for the manuscript will be shared. This data will also include a clear description or "data dictionary" to facilitate reuse. If ethical or practical concerns prevent sharing all of the data, we will share as much as we can and explain why the rest is not shared in the manuscript. However, concerns that prevent sharing should be strongly questioned if unreasonabe (an understandably subjective term).

## Analysis
All material and code needed for analysis will be shared. It is unclear

# Repositories for sharing
All research materials will be shared on a repository that is:
* open access to allow free download and reuse
* immutable to ensure that a single consistent identifier will always lead to a single repository (versions may replace it if past versions remain discoverable and viewable)
* uniquely identifiable to ensure and have a clear plan for persistence to allow access for reliable long-term access

Moreover, the artifacts will include a clear and open license for reuse.


All data collection and analyses will either be preregistered or explicitly described as "exploratory" or "descriptive". Any devations from a preregistration will be noted in the manuscript.

When possible, a preprint will be posted publicly, and open access piblications will be prioritized.

## IP
Intllectual property concerns may arise, specially for stimuli. While other people's intellectual property concerns may need to be protected
